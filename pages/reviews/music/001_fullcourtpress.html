                There is so much charisma on this album. I've always thought there was something special to 
                Wiz Khalifa since I first listened to Kush & Orange Juice, but I never pursued that interest 
                for some reason.

                Full Court Press was my first venture into anything with Wiz Khalifa other than Kush & Orange Juice 
                and the pop hit features he's had over the years. Lucky for me, this project also has Big K.R.I.T. 
                and Smoke DZA who are both interesting in their own right. I'm completely unfamiliar with Girl Talk 
                at this point but his solo work looks cool too.

                I can't really describe the feeling I got when I first turned on the album and heard Mind Blown for 
                the first time. I won't act like it was some transcendental experience that blew me away and changed 
                my perspective. It's a Southern Hip-Hop/Trap album after all it's not like it hasn't been done before. 
                I will say though it made me feel like I was about to listen to something that couldn't possibly be 
                made without smoking an intense amount of weed, and I think that perfectly sets the mood because that's 
                essentially what this tape feels like. I almost feel like I shouldn't even be listening to or enjoying 
                this album because I've never smoked in my life.

                That's not a bad thing, though! I think it plays into making the album as enjoyable as it is. I can't 
                remember a single lyric right now even though I just finished listening to it, but I'm not really a 
                lyric guy anyway. The lyrics don't matter here. I'm sure they're great and there are definitely some 
                clever lines on here (it's inevitable on a collab project between three incredibly charismatic rappers), 
                but even if there weren't I would still enjoy it. This isn't an art project or a landmark, it's an album 
                to put on when you feel like being in a good mood or while you're relaxing and chilling with friends.

                Great project really I do recommend giving it a listen!
