				Monumental. This isn't my first time listening to A Great Chaos (probably like my 10th), but 
				every time it impresses me so I feel like it's fitting to write a review here for it.

				AGC is like if you took raw energy and made it into an album. I know that's kinda the point of 
				rage anyways, but it really manifests best here. Not a single beat on this album (including deluxe) 
				is bad. Every single instrumental is brutal, not in like a slamming death metal evil way, but brutal 
				in that there is an insane feeling you get when you listen to it. Even with the most overwhelming
				body vibrating hyper instrumentals, Ken Car$on is the perfect complement to every. single. moment.

				Rage was always going to be an interesting genre and spawn some superstars, 
				but A Great Chaos feels like a complete reinvention. Listening to songs like Succubus makes you 
				feel like you've just been killed and stabbed to death. The song could've been about sunshine and 
				rainbows and I'd still feel this way.

				The best part of it all is that there's immense tracks like Succubus on the same album as something 
				as catchy and infectious as songs like Vampire Hour or Jennifer's Body. There was an entire day in 
				my life where I couldn't listen to any other song than Vampire Hour. I was walking around campus 
				with my earbuds in between classes and that was the only thing that would satisfy me. I'd put on a 
				different song only to turn it off a minute in and put Vampire Hour back on. I did the same thing with 
				Succubus, I did the same thing with Pots, I did the same thing with Hardcore. Not that these are the 
				only good songs by any means. It could've been basically whatever song I clicked on first that day.

				I know I probably sound like 00piumFanGuy001 writing this but I feel like AGC really is the monumental 
				game changing album that opium fans act like everything is. Ken Car$on repeatedly delivers the catchiest 
				flows with his unique vocals over insanely dense and overwhelming beats. Awesome stuff, especially for 
				the current mainstream rap climate (I know it came out a year ago but even now the impact continues).
			</p>
            <br>
			<p class="columnText">
				Strongly recommend for anyone who likes rap, even "oldheads". If you don't get it, that's okay, but I 
				really believe you'd be missing out on a turning point in the genre that makes rap feel more alive than 
				it has in a while.
