				I went into this game thinking it would probably be fun, 
				but I thought it would most likely be an overrated nostalgia bait 
				3D platformer with n64 graphics. I was wrong.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				The problem I have with a lot of the 3D platformer genre 
				is that the base movement mechanics are either entirely too floaty, 
				or the movement is so stiff that it feels like a Crash Bandicoot 
				clone without the difficulty or creative levels. That's not at all 
				the case here. Basically right away you're thrown into control of 
				your character, Sybil. She's a humanoid animal with exaggerated 
				features reminiscent of a Pokemon fan art, but in the best way. 
				She moves fluidly, there is definitely some weight to her movement 
				but it's not so fluid that you lose control when you need it. Keep 
				in mind, as this is a metroidvania, at this point in time you have 
				incredibly limited movement options.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				At the end of what serves as this game's tutorial, you're given your 
				first unlockable move and thrown into the world. And when I say 
				thrown into the world, I mean you are basically on your own from 
				this point forward and the rest of the game is an open environment 
				for you to explore.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				This is Pseudoregalia's strongest element by far. A lot of people 
				will tell you that Pseudoregalia is great for it's freedom of movement 
				and fluid mechanics, which is true and I'll get to that, but those 
				elements would be essentially meaningless without a suitable 
				environment to experiment in. Most platforming games where I REALLY 
				enjoyed the movement system suffer from a lack of difficulty and/or 
				exploration in their level design. Most platforming games where I 
				REALLY enjoyed the exploration or difficulty curve tend to have 
				clunky or uninspiring mechanics. Pseudoregalia is the first game I 
				have experienced in my lifetime that successfully gives me an 
				enticing environment and what feels like the best possibile tools 
				to explore it.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				It cannot be ignored that the visuals of this game are heavily 
				inspired by N64 era platformers, and on first impression this can 
				appear to be nostalgia bait to reel in people looking for a 
				refreshing childhood reminiscent experience. Maybe I'm coping and 
				I really did fall for the nostalgia bait but regardless I think 
				the visual style is appropriate here and adds to the atmosphere. 
				The level design is open ended and oftentimes the rooms you're in 
				feel like they've been broken apart specifically for you to move 
				through them. They still feel natural and inspired and unique, 
				but it really FEELS like you're supposed to be doing what you're doing.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				Thematically it is like a castle that you would imagine exploring in 
				a dream. Upon first glance it's like you're royalty. Your surroundings 
				make you feel important but small. It feels like you live here, you 
				belong here. For some reason though, it makes you feel like you need 
				to get out.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				This is not because it's scary, or because there's a sense of impending 
				doom or anything like that. It's because you want to explore. You can 
				tell there is a way forward, and each new area you discover is like a 
				new dream you've stepped into. Each area is dark and cold and vast but 
				feels familiar and uniquely designed for you. The enemies fill these 
				environments like they are its guardians. There isn't much variety here 
				but there doesn't need to be. The few enemy types feel like they know 
				each other, like they all work together to guard this place that you're 
				trying to pick apart.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				The combat in this game isn't very inspiring, but it is enough of a 
				challenge that it's engaging, and walking into a room full of enemies 
				is intimidating. There are occasions where the enemies are used 
				to aid the platforming, and some where the enemies are used to add 
				difficulty to the platforming. I don't really care about the combat 
				in this game, and I don't remember anything except for a very specific 
				encounter (which I will not spoil). It doesn't detract from the game 
				in any way though, especially since I have never once cared about 
				combat in a 3D platformer.
			</p>

				I saved the movement discussion for last because I'm scared of how 
				long I'm going to talk about it. The movement system in this game is 
				one of the most rewarding and satisfying movement systems I have seen 
				in a video game ever. It's a metroidvania, so by nature you unlock 
				abilities throughout your playthrough so that you can go back and 
				access areas you weren't able to before. Usually this is done through 
				walls that are breakable with certain abilities, high ledges that you 
				can't reach until you unlock something like a double jump, or 
				environmental hazards that you need an ability to traverse.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				Pseudoregalia does have a couple obstacles in this style, but it keeps 
				them to a minimum in favor of more open and technically-accessible-
				you-can-make-it-if-you-try-hard-enough obstacles. There are countless 
				times during my first playthrough where I looked at an obstacle, said 
				to myself "I don't think I'm supposed to do that yet", and then spent 
				10 minutes trying to do it anyway to find out that I in fact wasn't 
				"supposed" to yet but totally can because I'm getting good at the 
				movement. That might be the greatest feeling you can make a player 
				feel when designing an open-ended platformer. Not only is that possible 
				for almost every single challenge in this game, but it is apparent 
				that it's designed that way intentionally. Sometimes when you sequence 
				break a video game, you end up soft locking and you're in a spot that 
				you REALLY can't get out of. That is not the case here at all. Every 
				time I felt like i broke the sequence of the game, there was a little 
				reward waiting for me.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				Sometimes I'd go a direction that seemed entirely impossible, only to 
				find out that I was going the back way through a section that is normally 
				accessed from the other side of the map. I'd then find out the reason 
				it's normally accessed from the other side of the map is because there's 
				a new ability at the end, and there's an appropriate platforming 
				challenge leading up to it. Now I've gone in the other way, and I got 
				the new ability without discovering the "entrance" or doing the 
				intended challenge. Due to the nature of the environments though, this 
				didn't feel like I broke the game or missed out on something, because 
				every room makes you want to explore every opportunity. I'd break the 
				sequence and get this new ability just to go backwards through the 
				challenge rooms just so I could discover the area where the entrance was.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				Aside from these seemingly intentional sequence break options, there are 
				little bonus power-ups scattered throughout the map that can make 
				exploring easier, but aren't necessary to discover everything. This can 
				be as little as some extra damage or as impactful as an extra wall kick. 
				They're always in a clever spot where you have to think just a little 
				about how to get there, and it feels awesome when you do.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				To top it off, all the sound design and music in this game is phenomenal. 
				Sure the music is a little repetitive at times because it's difficult for 
				a solo dev to get a wide variety of music, but I never got tired of it. 
				It was droning in my ear contributing to the atmosphere rather than 
				pounding at my ear drums. The sounds to the movement make it feel like 
				there is significance to every action I take, even just jumping around 
				between platforms.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				I really don't think I'll experience something like Pseudoregalia again. 
				I finished it last week in a single sitting and immediately started 
				chasing that high looking for another game to play. I'm definitely going 
				to replay Pseudoregalia but I will never be able to find the feeling 
				this game gave me on the first playthrough. I'm playing other games 
				that are heavily recommended by fans of this one (currently Corn Kidz 64). 
				They're good. Great, even! But they don't offer the same thing that 
				Pseudoregalia does. Maybe it's recency bias since I've just finished it, 
				but this might be my favorite game of all time.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				I think it's obvious I'm going to recommend this one to any fans of 3D 
				platformers, exploration/atmosphere based games, or fans of good video 
				games in general. Definitely play it in any way you can to support the dev, 
				because I'm sure they're going to make big waves with their future games.
