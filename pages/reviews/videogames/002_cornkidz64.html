				What a fun little package! It's an indie game, and combined with it being a 
				3D platformer it has an understandably short runtime. It didn't feel too 
				short, though! It felt like I had time to get used to the mechanics, 
				play around with them enough to get good with them, and complete some 
				rewarding challenges just in time for the game to end.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				The mechanics to this game aren't <em>too</em> complicated or unique, but 
				they feel solid and provide for some enjoyable movement. The game's one 
				main mechanic is the headbutt. Seeing as you're a goat, this thematically 
				makes a lot of sense, and the implementation of it gives you a surprising 
				amount of freedom. Being one move, you can use it to gain distance in a 
				jump, gain vertical distance up a wall, and combined with some environmental 
				obstacles you can chain headbutts to cover large gaps.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				This sounds incredibly boring when I'm typing it out, but it was really a 
				fun system. Similar 3D platformers of this style often have the basics 
				like a double-jump, a simple attack, and a wall jump that rarely gets used. 
				Those games get repetitive and without an extremely fun environment and 
				good movement physics, they suck really bad. Corn Kidz 64 doesn't fall 
				into this trap despite it's limited moveset I described.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				I think this is largely due to the level design. There are two explorable 
				environments with multiple objectives, and two linear levels with a set 
				beginning and end. The two open ended levels are very distinct and have 
				a wide range of challenges.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				The first level is more about learning your moveset and seeing what you 
				can and can't do. There's basic platforming challenges, it introduces you 
				to some basic obstacles that you'll see throughout the rest of the game, 
				but still offers alternative routes to get to the same place that can 
				make the player feel clever once they've learned the ropes.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				The second level is much more open ended and the objectives are more 
				connected than in the first level. There are new enemy types, and in order 
				to truly explore the environment you'll have to use your entire toolset. 
				In both of these first two levels, the platforming itself is often not 
				the challenge. The challenge lies in determining which places are even 
				accessible to you in the first place. You'll have to press buttons to 
				unlock new paths, and one challenge often leads to another. Something 
				that seems unachievable to you at the time will likely be revealed in 
				a few minutes once you complete something else.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				It's in this second level you'll unlock a new tool that allows access 
				to basically everything that was previously inaccessible, since it's 
				the last move you get in the game. This tool is good and definitely 
				remains interesting for a little while, but I found it uninspiring to 
				use after the second level. It didn't feel like it had a nice flow with 
				the rest of your tools or even the environments for that matter. It 
				felt like "oh look that is a clear indicator I have to use this tool 
				to get to the next spot." Maybe it's a nitpick but it was by far my 
				least favorite mechanic in the game.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				I won't talk much about the last two levels, frankly because I don't 
				remember much of them. The third level is a pretty decent challenge 
				and there were definitely some moments where I realized maybe I wasn't 
				as good at this game as I thought, but I think that's a good thing. The 
				environment was not interesting to me at all, but it was short enough that 
				I didn't care in the moment.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				The very last level is only unlocked after you level up enough, and is 
				basically hell. It's called "Anxiety Tower" and that's pretty representative 
				of how it is to play. I'm not trashing on it for this, I'm just saying it was 
				actually gruelling to get through. The platforming is difficult and you'll 
				have to do some things you never thought were possible. The worst part of it 
				is that every time you die you start all the way back at the fucking beginning. 
				This made me rage quit halfway through and I had to come back to it later. 
				This was probably intentionally designed and added to the anxiety of the 
				"Anxiety Tower" for sure but Jesus Christ didn't intent for any human to 
				suffer through something like this.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				The game does have a lot of personality! The characters interact with each 
				other nicely and the humor isn't obnoxious or forced. The two open ended 
				levels have quirky environments and the graphics are the nostalgia-bait
				N64 graphics that are popular with 3D platformers right now (hence the 
				"64" in "Corn Kidz 64"). The character design is the thing that sells me. 
				The main character resembles something of a console mascot and all the 
				enemies are cartoonishly evil looking.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="columnText">
				Overall I enjoyed it but I think there's definitely some things to be improved 
				on. If the last two levels had cooler visuals and weren't just "tower of 
				obstacles" and the unlockable tool had more ways to flow with the rest of 
				Seve's moves this game would hold a lot more weight with me. The base mechanics 
				are really fun and the level design as far as platforming goes are incredible. 
				I'll probably replay this the next time I'm craving a similar experience, and I 
				definitely recommend it for fans of the genre.
